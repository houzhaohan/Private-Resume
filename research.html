                <h3>Research and Application of CLIP Pre-training Model Based on Hash Algorithm in Cross-modal Retrieval and Localization of Farmland Insect Images</h3>

                <p class="research-supervisor">Supervisor: Yihua Zhu (Associate Professor)</p>
                <p class="research-description">
                    This project develops an intelligent retrieval and localization visualization system for agricultural insect images, using B/S architecture, including frontend interactive interface, backend processing module, and data storage layer. The frontend supports functions such as user registration, login, image upload, and retrieval; The backend is based on the Flask framework, integrating CLIP model for image and text feature extraction, and introducing Hash algorithm to improve retrieval efficiency and system scalability. The data layer uses binary Hash index to store features, greatly improving retrieval speed.
                    The system supports cross modal retrieval based on natural language description, and users can input text such as "snail" and "snail at leaves" to query target insect images. By combining the image data obtained from the camera network deployed in farmland, the system can retrieve insect images in the field and quickly locate and visualize the insect situation based on location information. The search results can be presented as scatter plots and heat maps, helping agricultural technicians accurately grasp the location and density of pest infestations.
                    This system supports early warning and targeted control of pests in precision agriculture, which can significantly reduce pesticide use, reduce environmental pollution, and improve prevention and control efficiency. The system also has model fine-tuning and incremental learning functions, supporting continuous optimization of retrieval performance. Historical data can be used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of insect infestation, providing a basis for planting plans and control strategies, and promoting the development of smart plant protection and green agriculture.

                <h3>Analysis of Martingale Strategy in Quantitative Trading Market Based on BiLSTM-Attention Model</h3>
                <h4>Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</h4>

                <p class="research-description">
                    This study proposes an improved Martingale Strategy based on the BiLSTM-Attention model, aimed at addressing the problem of insufficient adaptability of traditional Martingale Strategy under extreme market conditions. We have developed a predictive model that can capture the long-term temporal dependence of stock prices and designed a multidimensional dynamic management mechanism based on it. This mechanism integrates technical indicators such as RSI and MACD, volatility adjustment modules, and sliding window profit and loss strategies to achieve adaptive risk control.

                    This project integrates multiple statistical techniques, including factor analysis and path analysis, through multidimensional scales and structural equation modeling, enabling the simultaneous handling of relationships between latent and observed variables. In the study, "artificial intelligence literacy," "digital divide," "cognitive absorption," and "computational thinking" are defined as latent variables and measured through multiple observed indicators. The project plans to collect data through questionnaires, use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for parameter estimation, test the goodness of fit of the model (such as CFI, RMSEA, SRMR, etc.), and verify the structural relationships between variables through the analysis of standardized regression coefficients.
                    The project also conducted reliability and validity tests, including evaluating the reliability of the items through factor loadings and testing the convergent validity of the scale through Composite Reliability (CR) and Average Variance Extracted (AVE), to ensure the reliability and validity of the measurement tool. Through this series of statistical modeling and hypothesis testing processes, the project constructed a theoretically grounded and statistically robust model of factors influencing artificial intelligence literacy, thereby providing scientific support for empirical research and educational intervention.

                <p class="research-description">
                    Through on-site research at the China Random Needle Embroidery Cultural Industrial Park and Zhuping Tang's Master of Skills Studio, we gained a deep understanding of the production process and artistic features of random needle embroidery. With the help of digital media technology, we recorded the creative process and technical details of the embroidery products. The team also had in-depth exchanges with intangible cultural heritage inheritors such as Yuanhua Mo and Yuanguo Mo, discussing how to enhance the dissemination and influence of random needle embroidery through modern technological means.
                    Based on the first-hand materials collected, the team designed and developed a web-based display platform for Luanzhen embroidery, presenting the historical background, craftsmanship process and cultural connotation of Luanzhen embroidery to the public through multimedia forms such as text, images and videos. This platform not only realizes the digital archiving and display of random needle embroidery works, but also attempts to enhance users' sense of participation and immersion through interactive experiences, promoting the dissemination and regeneration of intangible cultural heritage in the digital space.
                    In addition, the team also combined their professional data processing and analysis capabilities to conduct a systematic study on the current inheritance status and development path of random needle embroidery, wrote a research report and put forward a series of protection suggestions based on digital technology.
                    The team also held a non-heritage publicity event for teenagers in Lianhua Community, Anyi Town. By combining digital display with interactive teaching, it aimed to stimulate the younger generation's interest and recognition of random needle embroidery. This activity not only demonstrates the application value of information technology in cultural education, but also showcases its practical potential in rural revitalization and cultural inheritance.
